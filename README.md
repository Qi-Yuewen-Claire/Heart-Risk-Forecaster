# Heart-Risk-Forecaster
A heart disease machine learning prediction model built from a 300K-record healthcare dataset.

The model, implemented through both Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms, achieved precision and recall rates of 87%. Importantly, feature importance was used to optimize the model and shed light on the most influential factors in heart disease prediction.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease) from Kaggle, which includes over 300,000 entries.


## Repository Contents

- `Heart Risk Model Training.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the full code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The notebook includes explanations and visualizations to help understand each step of the process.

## Key Highlights
